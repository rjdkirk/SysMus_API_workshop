# This script provides a basic set up for connecting with the Spotify API and extracting playlist data. This
# will run through:
#    1. Set up - loading packages and authenticating API access.
#    2. Create a function for extracting data from individual playlists.
#    3. Create a function for extracting data from multiple playlists.
#    4. Run those functions, save and export your data. 
    
# This code is based on this article:
# https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-large-music-datasets-using-spotipy-40e7242cc6a6



#%% 1. Set up

# First we need to add certain packages that we'll use in our program. Anaconda comes with most of what 
# we need, but we also need to install Spotipy. In the comand window (bottom right if you're using the default
# layout), type (or copy and paste) the following:
#   conda install -c conda-forge spotipy 
# While you're at it, install this other package as well - weâ€™ll need this for our plots later:
#   conda install -c conda-forge ptitprince
# You may get a note saying that you might need to restart the kernel; to do this, press ctrl . (full stop). 

# Now, we can import our packages.
import csv
import pandas as pd
import spotipy
from spotipy.oauth2 import SpotifyClientCredentials

client_id = '0deb2c8118c84199b3d521323c83e357'
client_secret = '9284f5c45884451d8b8065515fa2b7c5'
client_credentials_manager = SpotifyClientCredentials(client_id=client_id, client_secret=client_secret)
sp = spotipy.Spotify(client_credentials_manager=client_credentials_manager)

# This is the basic Spotipy function to retrieve information for every track in a playlist:
# sp.user_playlist_tracks('CREATOR', 'PLAYLIST_ID')
# Try this on an example:
sp.user_playlist_tracks('Spotify', '37i9dQZF1DWV7EzJMK2FUI')
# The output is quite unweildy, so we need to tidy it up.



#%% 2. 

# This will create a function for analysing a single playlist.
